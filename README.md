# gcc

> Good C Compiler

gcc is a C compiler, written in OCaml. As of now, it doesn't do much, but it will hopefully get more powerful in due time. For now, it generates a generic assembly instruction set, and then this will be compiled to platform specific code.

## Resources

I have a bigger list of resources elsewhere, but I'm too late to port them over for now.
